;Newtons method for square-root approximations
; (For my understanding)

;Given a guess, improve the guess up to a tolerance:
;e.g. to get the square root of 2,
;we make the guess of 1
;
;
;Step 1. Get the quotient. The quotient is:
;(2 / 1)
;
;so
;
;current_quotient = (number_to_square / current guess)
;
;Step 2. Average the quotient with current guess.
;Like:
;
;((2 + 1) / 2) = 1.5
;
;so
;
;next_guess = ((current_quotient + current_guess) / 2)
